# MazeGenerator
Author: Thomas Eberhart

This program is an automatic maze generator. No user input is required. Just start it up and the program will work its magic. 

This program was made using the olcPixelGameEngine, a game engine created by the Youtube content creator javidx9. All code in the olcPixelGameEngine.h header file is his and was not created by me.
